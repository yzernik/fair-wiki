# trustless-wiki
A wiki that is fair and trustless

trustless-wiki has clear rules about how pages are edited:

- The wiki starts without any pages.

- To create a new page, a user must spend bitcoin (any amount) into a contract associated with the new page.

- To make an edit to an existing page, a user must spend a larger amount than the previous editor in that page's contract. When an edit happens, the previous editor gets back whatever amount of bitcoin they have locked up in the contract.

- The amount of bitcoin required to edit a page can only go up over time, because each edit requires more than the previous one.
